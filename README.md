# Credit-Risk_Classification


## Overview of the Analysis

This dataset was used to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using various information about the individuals loans, debts, accounts and income, a Logestic Regression Model was used to classify the risk level of a loan.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * After testing and training the data set, the overall accuracy score was .99. Both the weighted recall and precision averagew were .94.
  * The healthy loan scores were solid, 1.00 for each accuracy, recall and precision.
  * The high-risk loan scores were lower with .87 for precision, .89 for recall and .88 for accuracy.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * After testing and training the resampled data set, all scores were 1.00.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
